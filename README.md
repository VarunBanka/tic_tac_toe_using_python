TIC TAC TOE
Here's a tic tac toe game made using python.

Build:
   Source code :
     https://gist.github.com/VarunBanka/9361931d3746690e16cf5ad715e50bcc
Making exe file:
   I've used a module named pyinstaller which lets us convert python xode to exe file.
     pip install pyinstaller
     {Open power shell as admin in directory where py file is located}
     pyinstaller --onefile {file name with extinction .py}

Done :D
Thanks and regards
